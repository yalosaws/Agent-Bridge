    "Antigravity, DeepSeek Harness, OpenCode, Claude Code, Codex CLI, Devin CLI) and keeps their "
    "sessions resumable.\n"
    "Hard rules: workers are reached only through these tools — never drive the "
    "worker CLIs or GUIs directly. dispatch_task.cwd is this conversation's "
    "project folder (absolute), not the Agent Bridge install path. A wait_task "
    "timeout is not failure; call it again. Verify results with get_result plus "
    "your own git diff — do not trust a worker's self-report. An empty Kimi "
    "result with non-empty warnings is a failed turn, not a no-op.\n"
    "Call list_agents first. Read coordinator.mode, coordinator.instructions, "
    "coordinator.runtime_context, and coordinator.dispatch_enabled. User "
    "preferences in instructions override default worker routing. Each "
    "agents[] row carries quota: status ok/exhausted/unknown, rolling windows "
    "with remaining_percent and resets_at, and optional provider-reported balance for "
    "workers. Custom API/auth endpoints are unsupported; cached readings expire at window reset. unknown means Bridge could not read it, not that it is empty; "
    "an exhausted worker will most likely fail its turn. Quota is information "
    "for you and the user, not a routing rule — instructions still decide. "
    "Claude quota.status covers only shared 5h/weekly limits. Before dispatch, "
    "check the requested model's weekly:opus or weekly:sonnet window even when "
    "status is ok. A zero remaining_percent means that model is exhausted: "
    "report its reset time or use an alternative allowed by the user's routing "
    "instructions. Missing or null readings mean unknown; model-specific windows "
    "alone cannot establish the shared status. If "
    "dispatch_enabled is false, this Bridge was inherited inside a worker "
    "process — do not call dispatch_task, set_preferences, cancel_task, "
    "or end_session. When "
    "dispatch_enabled is true and the user states a lasting preference, "
